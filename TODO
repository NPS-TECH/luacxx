#2 Ask questions

Here's the process:

1. Tell Tentacles to ask me a question periodically, optionally with
answers provided.

Question
{
	String question
	Choices answers
	Period period
};

2. Tentacles saves the question and answers.

3. I log in online.

4. Tentacles checks to see if any questions are waiting to be answered.

Set<Question> questions

5. On the page, these questions are posed to me.

6. I respond to the questions asked.

7. Tentacles saves my responses.

What's the simplest thing that could possibly work?

In other words, what do I currently know/have?

FritoMod + nCurses + C++.
