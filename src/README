=head1 NAME

lua-cxx, luacxx - C++11 API for creating Lua bindings

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    // Create a new Lua environment to play with.
    auto env = lua::create();

    // Introduce a global into Lua
    env["foo"] = "No time";

    // Run some Lua code directly
    lua::run_string("assert(foo == 'No time')");

    // Retrieve a global
    auto value = env["foo"].get<std::string>();
    assert(value == "No time");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lua-cxx is a set of functions and objects designed to bridge Lua and C++11.
The Lua C API can be mixed with this project's facilities as desired.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Lua-cxx uses Automake as its build system, so the process is conventional:

    git clone https://github.com/dafrito/lua-cxx.git

    cd lua-cxx
    autoreconf -i
    ./configure
    make -j
    make install

=head1 STYLE

STL conventions are used for naming and case, though not slavishly, to
infer that a template-heavy C++ dialect is used. However, adherance to Lua's
conventions is preferred over that of C++. For instance, the lua::state is
passed as a pointer, even though it should rightfully be a reference.

=head1 THREAD-SAFETY

The thread-safety guarantees provided by Lua shall not be infringed due to the
use of Lua-cxx.

Lua-cxx does modify global state external to Lua itself such as to support
custom QVariant types. Thread-safety for these methods has not been determined.
